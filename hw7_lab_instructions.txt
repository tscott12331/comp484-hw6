  HW7 Resume Site

In this hw, youâ€™ll continue working on your resume site. You can continue buliding 
on from HW6.

1.	Update the index.html file
			a.	Let's update our projects by adding in the content wrappers. To 
            keep the text from spanning across the whole page, starting with the header.
            Add the first new <div class="content-wrap"> just after the header tag. We 
            want to make sure we enclose all of the content, but stay within the sections.
            It should contain all elements that the header contains.   

            b. Go back to the CSS now and add in this style in the global section. We're 
            going to keep this style here in the global section, because it's going to 
            be reused throughout the project. Give it a width: 950px; margin: 0 auto; 

2. Go back to your HTML and add that content wrapper to the rest of the page.
            a. Add one in the work section right after the section tag. Make sure that 
            the closing tag encloses around the content. So it should be right before 
            the closing section tag. 

            b. Add one in the education section and also the footer section. Also make 
            sure you keep your HTML indented properly so that you can easily see where 
            your opening and closing tags are. 

            c. save work and examine your results in chrome with different window 
            sizings.
 
            d. To make the content wrapper flexible, but while still setting the width 
            on the content, instead of using a width, we can use max-width instead. 
            Let's go back to our CSS file and make that update. In the content-wrap 
            selector update remove the width property with max-width: 950px;

3. Practice with padding and spacing.
            a. Still in the .content-wrap selector add some padding. I'm going to go 
            with one value 50 pixels, (padding: 50px;). By adding padding to the content 
            wrap, all the page sections using this class will have the same amount of 
            padding. And this will help to keep your designs more consistent.

            b. Now you may notice that while we added the same amount of padding around 
            the entire content wrapper, there's a small difference in the amount of 
            space between the top of the wrapper and the bottom. And that's because 
            there is margin around the heading element. Remove the margin at the top, 
            so that the wrapper padding is more consistent.

            c. . Back in your CSS file, find your h2 selector, and we're going to set 
            the margin-top to zero (margin-top: 0;). And that's going to remove the 
            margin space, just from the top of the element. Save it, refresh it, check 
            it in the browser.
            
            d. Next, let's address the white border around the entire page. You could 
            see it on the left, on the bottom, the right side, and the top. Just like 
            the spacing between the sections, this is coming from the default margin as 
            well, but from the body element, and that's why it's wrapping the entire page.
            So let's go ahead and remove that. Back in your CSS file, find your body 
            selector and set the margin to zero (margin: 0;). Now the white space is 
            gone and the background colors span all the way across
        
            e. Let's go back to the footer. We should probably add some space in 
            between these links. Also, longer blocks of text are usually easier to 
            read when it's left align, but since there's not much content here, let's 
            also center align the text. Back in our CSS file, let's go down to the 
            footer section. Use footer as your selector add the property (text-align: 
            center). Save it, and refresh your browser. By adding text-align center to 
            the footer, all of the child elements within have inherited the style.

            f. Back in our HTML file, to make sure that we add the styles only to the 
            links within the footer, we're going to add a class to this div that's 
            containing all the links. After the h2 tag that says "Let's Keep in Touch!" 
            Add a <div class="contact-info">. This div should contain all the anchor tags.
            
            g. Back in the CSS file, Create a new declaration block, and name it 
            (.contact-info a{} ) I'm also going to apply these styles to the links, 
            so I'm using a descendant selector, a to target the links inside of the 
            contact-info class. Inside that selector set  the values of (padding: 10px; 
            display: inline-block;) I'm going to choose the value of inline-block, 
            because I still want these elements to align side by side, in a line, but 
            I also wanted to apply the padding properly, like block level elements.

4. Practicing with floats in the header
            a. So the first thing we're going to focus on is the profile image. 
            Something to note, images can be resized with CSS, but it's best to crop 
            the file to the size that you need it to be. The larger the image, the 
            more bandwidth the browser will use to load it. In the CSS, let's set the 
            width and height of our profile image to 300 pixels.

            b. In the HTML add a class inside the image tag and name it profile-img. 
            That way you can make sure to target only this image in the CSS. Also add 
            it to the header section in your CSS (.profile-img{}). Inside that 
            selector set the (width: 300px;). You don't need to set the height, 
            because by setting the width, the height will automatically adjust to 
            maintain the aspect ratio of the image. Go ahead and save the file and check 
            your changes in the browser.

            c. Add one more CSS style to .profile-image selector called border-radius 
            give it a value of 50%. (border-radius:50%;) Save it and go back to the 
            browser.

            d. The next thing we're going to do is tighten up the header design by 
            removing some margins. I want the h1 name  and the h2 tagline to be closer 
            together so remove the margin from both of these h1s and h2 headings. Back 
            in your CSS go to your header h1, header h2 selector and add (margin: 0;) 
            there. Go ahead and go back to the browser and check for your changes.

            e. Float the text around the image, add a float: left to the profile-img 
            selector.

            f. Add the overflow property to the content-wrap selector. Use the value of 
            hidden.

            g. Add a little bit of margin on the right side of your image, just to put 
            some space between it and the text. Back in the profile-img selector, add 
            (margin-right: 30 px). Save and go back to the browser and check for your 
            changes. 

5. Add the box model fix
            a. Let's add the box model fix. Use the snippet from the lecture and add it 
            to your CSS file. This is going to go at the very top of your style sheet. 
            Add it to the global section since this style is applied to every single 
            element on the page.

6. Add some columns to your page
            a. The first step is to put a box around all of the text elements to group 
            them as one component. Let's go back to the HTML file. We'll use a div tag 
            to create the container because this is only for styling purposes. And we'll 
            add a class as well. We're going to be creating two columns, so we can call 
            it column-narrow and column-wide. You'll be using these column styles again 
            to align the content in the work experience section. So this is going to be 
            a reusable style.
            
            b. In the HTML add a class of column-narrow to your img tag.
            
            c. add a new <div class="column-wide"> that contains the h1, h2, and 
            paragraph tags in your header section. 
            
            d. In your CSS set the style properties for the newly added .column-narrow 
            selector to width: 30%; float left; padding-right: 3%; min-height 175px;
            
            e. Set the style properties for the newly added .column-wide to width: 70%; 
            float left; min-height: 225px;
            
            f. remove or comment out the width, float, and margin values from the 
            profile-img selector. Since we'll be using these new global column styles 
            instead to align the content. You can keep the border-radius: 50%; property. 
            
            g. Back in your html file add divs and classes to your Work Experince 
            section to apply our new styling.
                i. add a new <div class="column-narrow"> that contatins the h3 Job tile, 
                p Company Name, and p Date at job tags in your Job Details section. 
                ii. add a new <div class="column-wide"> that contatins the p Job summary,
                p Optional list, and the ul tags in you Job Details section. 
                iii. make sure to add that to all your job items..
