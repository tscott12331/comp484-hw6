HW6 Resume Site

In this hw, youâ€™ll work on your resume site. I'll be providing the starting HTML 
markup (index.html) so you can dive into the CSS right away. You can customize 
the content however you wish. But make sure to keep the HTML structure pretty 
much the same to be able to follow along with the exercises.

1.	Populate the index.html file
			a.	Take some time to customize your starter file and personalize 
                the content.

2.  Make appropiate css and images folders to store and link files..

3.	Link external style sheet
            a.	In the head of your page, use the link element to link to the 
                styles.css file. Be sure to remember to define the styles.css 
                relationship as stylesheet.
            b. Do a quick test just to make sure that the files are linked together 
                properly. An example can be setting the background color.

4. Pick a color pallete for your site. 
            a. Look online for a color pallete. 
            b. Copy and paste your color codes in the commented section in the 
               styles.css file.
            c. In your styles.css file change the background color of each header, 
               footer, work experience, and education section.
            d. Add classes as needed.
            e. Adjust font colors if needed

5.	Pick two Google Fonts and add them to your site (https://fonts.google.com/)
			a.	Go to the Google Fonts website explore and pick two web-safe 
                fonts for your site
			b.	The fonts you select will be added to a collection in the selected 
                families. 
			c. Copy the standard embed link. This should look familiar since it's 
                using the same link tag we use to add our CSS file. This snippet will 
                actually link to Google Style Sheet, and this is how the font families 
                are loaded onto your webpage
            d. Add the code snippet to the head section of your index file and put it 
               right before the styles.css file.
            e. Now that our new fonts are loaded into the page, set a new default font 
               family back in styles.css for body, h1, h2, etc. 

6.  In your styles.css file
            a. adjust the font size of your h1 and h2 tags so that it stands out more 
                accordingly. 
            b. feel free to play around with the font family, or font sizes of the other 
                headings or body text, as you wish

7. Add some font-weight properties
            a. In the Google Fonts site go back and take a look at the options for selecting 
               different typefaces and font weights. After you've selected your font choices 
               open the drawer and go to this Customize tab. Here you'll see options for different 
               font weights. You can choose as many as you'd like but the more you choose, the 
               more resources your page has to load. So only add what you need.
            b. copy the new embed code and update it to your html file.
