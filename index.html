                <p>Description: Web app to create and save notes. Built using Vite, TypeScript, NextJS, and PostgreSQL.</p>
                <p>This was my first attempt at using NextJS. In doing this project, I learned many 
                things about the infrastructure. I learned about NextJS's server actions, middleware, 
                app router, and much more. Overall, I feel that this project allowed me to get 
                comfortable with the framework and understand why so many people use it.</p>

                <p>Description: Twitch chat client build using Electron, Vite, TypeScript, and React.</p>
                <p>This project was something I was interested in doing for a while, but I 
                just never knew how to approach it. It had always felt a bit overwhelming 
                since I had never created a desktop app. However, after learning about 
                Electron, I realized I could just use my web development skills to create 
                a desktop app.</p>
                <p>Not only did this project teach me about Electron and how it works, I 
                also had to dive deep into the Twitch API in order to make it work. Some of the 
                challenges this project brought were: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Properly connecting to the Twitch EventSub WebSocket server in 
                        order to get chats from the correct channel
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Parsing messages in order to display emotes and mentions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adding real time text to image conversion in the message area while 
                        typing
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Description: ECommerce site made with Vite, React, and .NET</p>
                <p>As a part of my intro to sofware engineering project, the class was tasked with 
                creating a project of our choice; our group decided on making a mock ECommerce site. 
                The team was split into one person for the backend, and two for the frontend. I 
                ended up on the frontend team. Since my teammate had experience with React, we 
                decided on using that for the frontend even though I had very little experience 
                with it at the time.</p>
                <p>As one can image, this was a big learning experience for me. By the end of 
                the semester, I felt much more comfortable with React than I did at the start. 
                As a matter of fact, this is the project that made me begin using React on all 
                of my personal web projects since it just felt so good to use.</p>
